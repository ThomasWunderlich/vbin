DETAIL DESCRIPTIONS
===================

* col_sum 

  Add up a column of numbers

  Syntax:
     col_sum [ <col_num> ]

      col_num - zero based.
                Default is 0.

  Example:

     Sum available diskspace across all drives in MB.

        df -m | col_sum +3

     Count number of classes all python programs: 
    
        grep -c class *.py | cut -d':' -f2 | col_sum


* histogram 

  Generate a histogram from a list of data.   

  Example:

    Given spreadsheet of names and addresses, as a csv file, answer
    the question: How many people come from each state:

    cut -d',' -f6 professors.csv | histogram


* revver

  Create versioned copies of a file with postfixes: _1, _2, etc.
  It is inspired by VMS O/S.

  Always wise to make a copy of a system file before editing it.

  Syntax:

    revver [-u] filea [fileb, ...]
    -u  to unroll revisions

  Example:

     The following command

        revver list list_1

     Does:

        mv -f list list_1

     After recreating the original list and running the same command a
     second time you will see:

        mv -f list_1 list_2
        mv -f list list_1

     The -u command undoes a revision.  So

        revver -u list

     Does:

        mv -f list_1 list
        mv -f list_2 list_1
         

* sav

  Create a saved copy of a file, preserving timestamp and permissions

  ADMIN: Always wise to save copy of a system file before editing it.

  Example:

     The following command is equivalent to: cp -p professors.csv.sav
  
     sav professors.csv


  See, Also: 

     savdiff, unsav, revver


* savdiff

  Compare a file with its saved version.

  Example:

     The following is equivalent to: diff professors.csv professors.csv.sav
    savdiff professors.csv

  See, Also:
     sav, unsav, revver
  
* unsav

  Un save a copy of a file

  Example:
     The following command is equivalent to: 
      cp -p professors.csv.sav professors.csv

    unsav professors.csv

  See, Also:

     sav, savdiff, revver
